# dsh-digital-life

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

`dsh-digital-life` adds configurable conversational digital-life agents to DeepSeek Harness as an installable Host and Client Cordis plugin.

## Features

- Persists records in the `digital-life` settings namespace and each identity in `$DSH_HOME/digital-life/<id>/agents/<id>.md`.
- Imports persona identities from agent Markdown files such as `~/.agent/agents/xxx.md` and `~/.claude/agents/xxx.md` (YAML frontmatter is ignored).
- Adds a Harness-styled settings section for creating, editing, enabling, and deleting records.
- Adds `consult_digital_life` for one independent consultation.
- Adds `consult_digital_life_category` for parallel category consultation.
- Registers an `@<id>` input source for selecting configured records.
- Injects a Chat Panel through the additive `sidebar.footer.action` Slot without replacing the Harness sidebar or workspace browser.
- Creates conversations without a Workspace and starts standalone conversations initialized with a selected digital-life persona.
- Registers `digital-life-mode` in Harness's native Agent preset selector and Agent presets settings. Choose a specific identity from the conversation selector or the sidebar Chat Panel.

## Record fields

Each record has an `id`, `name`, `description`, primary-domain `category`, composable `tags[]`, `agent`, `persona`, and `enabled` flag. `agent` is the only runtime identity source. When no Agent file is supplied, saving a record writes `persona` to the managed `<id>/agents/<id>.md` file and stores that relative path in `agent`; when an Agent file is supplied, its Markdown body is authoritative and `persona` is ignored. New records using the `custom` category should set `customCategory`; older records without it fall back to the display name. `toolFilter` and `model` are optional. The Host validates the settings document and creates one-shot consultations with the configured subagent provider. See [`docs/think-tank-agent-team.md`](docs/think-tank-agent-team.md) for the proposed Think Tank agent-team design.

## Install from GitHub

`dsh-digital-life` is installed into a DeepSeek Harness **Web Profile**. The commands below are run from the Harness checkout, not from the plugin repository.

### Prerequisites

- A working DeepSeek Harness checkout
- Node.js and pnpm versions supported by that Harness checkout
- A GitHub URL for this repository

### Install

```sh
cd /path/to/deepseek-harness
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/elonnzhang/dsh-digital-life.git
```

The command installs the plugin into `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web`, adds its bundle to the Web Profile, and applies its Host and Client halves on the next boot.

Start the Web Profile:

```sh
pnpm dsh web --port 3080
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080`, then go to **Settings → 数字生命**.

> GitHub installs run the package's `prepare` script and build `lib/` from source. For a reproducible
> release, run the checks locally before pushing:
>
> ```sh
> cd /path/to/dsh-digital-life
> pnpm install
> pnpm run check
> git add .gitignore .npmrc src scripts docs package.json pnpm-lock.yaml tsconfig.json tsconfig.types.json tsdown.config.ts tsdown.client.ts cordis.patch.yml README.md README.zh.md
> git commit -m "build: update plugin contract"
> git push
> ```

> With pnpm 10+, a GitHub install may require an explicit `allowBuilds` entry in the target Profile;
> see [docs/publish.md](docs/publish.md).

### Update or uninstall

From the Harness checkout:

```sh
# Update the installed GitHub dependency
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-digital-life

# Remove it from the Web Profile
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-digital-life
```

Restart `pnpm dsh web` after installing, updating, or removing the plugin.

### Local development

Link the checkout into the profile once, then iterate against the running server:

```sh
cd /path/to/dsh-digital-life
pnpm install
pnpm run check

cd /path/to/deepseek-harness
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-digital-life
pnpm dsh web --port 3080
```

#### Build

`pnpm run build` runs `tsdown` over both halves and then refreshes the declaration compatibility tree:

| Artifact | Entry | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/index.js` | `src/index.ts` | the Host, applied by cordis |
| `lib/index.d.ts` | Host declarations | TypeScript consumers |
| `lib/invariant.js` | `src/invariant.ts` | `exports["./invariant"]` |
| `lib/client.js` | `src/client/index.ts` | the browser, served at `/plugins/dsh-digital-life/client.js` |
| `lib/types/client/index.d.ts` | Client declarations | TypeScript consumers of `./client` |

`lib/index.d.ts` and `lib/invariant.d.ts` are generated by tsdown. `build:types` additionally emits
the per-file `lib/types/**` declarations required by the dual-face Client export. The Client runtime
entry itself remains a loader-registration artifact rather than a normal importable browser library.

The client artifact is not an ordinary browser bundle. The web shell's module loader requires it to
register itself by calling `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })`; one that loads without
registering fails plugin boot with `bundle … loaded without registering "dsh-digital-life"`.
`tsdown.client.ts` produces that wrapper (CJS output inside a factory banner and footer), keeps the
shell's module-table specifiers external so they survive as `require()` calls the loader can answer,
and compiles every stylesheet into a style-injection module with hashed class names. Replacing it with
a plain browser-bundle config breaks plugin boot rather than just the styling.

#### Hot reload

A running `dsh web` stat-polls every client bundle it serves, so rewriting `lib/client.js` is the entire trigger — no server restart and no page refresh:

```sh
cd /path/to/dsh-digital-life
pnpm run dev
```

On a content change the Host broadcasts a `rebuilt` frame over its `GET /plugins/events` channel and the browser half swaps the cordis fiber in place: it drops the stale factory, refetches the bundle, drains the old fiber's disposers, removes the `<style data-plugin="dsh-digital-life">` tags, and re-applies. Component state inside the swapped subtree is lost; the rest of the page keeps running.

Two kinds of change stay outside that chain and need `dsh web` restarted: the Host half, because node-side plugin reloading is not mounted in the Web Profile, and `cordis.patch.yml`, because composition is read at boot.

Do not reach for the Harness's own `pnpm run dev:web` here. It is the watch build for packages inside the Harness checkout, it must not run concurrently with `pnpm run build` there, and it rebuilds nothing for an out-of-tree package.

For the package contract, local overlays, and distribution choices, see
[`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md), [`docs/load-into-dsh.md`](docs/load-into-dsh.md), and
[`docs/publish.md`](docs/publish.md).

## Usage

### 1. Configure digital lives

Open **Settings → 数字生命** after the Web Profile starts. Add or edit a record with:

The plugin UI follows the Harness locale and provides complete English and Simplified Chinese dictionaries. Switching the application language updates Settings, Chat Panel, and conversation selectors without translating user-authored names, descriptions, or Persona content.

- **ID**: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, for example `startup-mentor`
- **Name**: the display name, for example `创业导师`
- **Description**: a short responsibility summary
- **Category**: `business`, `science`, `culture`, or `custom`
- **Custom category**: recommended when `Category` is `custom`
- **Tags**: searchable capabilities such as `创业`, `现金流`
- **Persona**: the initial identity and response rules; converted to a managed Agent file when **Agent** is empty
- **Enabled**: only enabled records appear in selection and category consultation

You can enter a Host-readable path to bind an existing Agent Markdown file. Its YAML frontmatter is ignored and its Markdown body is the runtime identity. A file selected through the browser is instead imported into the managed file because the browser does not expose a path that the Host can reopen. When no external path is entered, the Persona is written to:

```text
$DSH_HOME/digital-life/<id>/agents/<id>.md
```

An external Agent file remains the sole source of identity and is not copied or overwritten by the plugin.

The settings document is normally:

```text
$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml
```

### 2. Choose the consultation provider

Set **子代理 Provider** to a mounted subagent provider. Keep the default `spawn` unless your Harness profile installs another provider. Set **分类最大咨询数** to the maximum number of enabled records that `consult_digital_life_category` may consult in parallel. This limit does not affect standalone sessions.

### 3. Use a digital life from the composer

Type `@` in the composer and select a record, for example `@startup-mentor`. The `@<id>` text helps the main Agent choose the `consult_digital_life` tool; it is not an automatic command. The model may still decide whether a consultation is useful.

The available tools are:

- `consult_digital_life(id, question)`: ask one configured digital life
- `consult_digital_life_category(category, question)`: ask enabled records in one category in parallel and compare their answers

### 4. Start an independent conversation

Choose a digital life from the conversation selector or open **Chat Panel** in the sidebar. If no project is selected, the plugin creates an isolated project under `~/.dsh/digital-life/projects/<datetime>` before opening the session. The composer remains blocked until a digital life is selected.

The standalone session has no Workspace (`workspaceId`/`cwd`), receives a record-specific system prompt through Host binding, and is forced to the **read-only file sandbox**. The selected identity is saved under `$DSH_HOME/digital-life/sessions/` so it survives a Host restart. The opening message is brief and does not repeat the full persona. The mode exposes digital-life consultation tools, not file-editing tools.

Inside a standalone digital-life session, mentioning another record as `@<id>` requires `consult_digital_life`; the current digital life must not imitate or answer for that record. Mentioning the current record's own ID is answered directly without a self-consultation.

### 5. Update the plugin

After publishing a new GitHub revision, build the plugin before pushing. Then update it from the Harness checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-digital-life
pnpm dsh web --port 3080
```

If the profile still uses an old linked installation, remove and add it again:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-digital-life
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/elonnzhang/dsh-digital-life.git
```

## Model Experience

Consultation tools add their schemas to the main agent's model request. A single consultation starts one child agent and returns its text. Category consultation starts up to `maxBatchSize` enabled records in parallel. A standalone digital-life conversation receives a record-specific system prompt, is set to the read-only file sandbox, and starts with a brief first user message; the role instruction is carried by the system prompt and remains durable and model-visible in that Session.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

In a regular Chat, `@<id>` is model-visible text that helps the agent choose `consult_digital_life`; it is not an automatic command. In a standalone digital-life session, the durable system prompt requires other-record mentions to use the consultation tool while self-mentions are answered directly. The current public sidebar has no additive Slot above the workspace browser, so Chat Panel uses the supported footer action Slot. Standalone digital-life sessions use the `digital-life-mode` Agent preset when it is available; otherwise they use the deployment default. Per-record model selection is not yet applied during Session creation.
